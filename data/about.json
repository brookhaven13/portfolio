  "paragraph": [
    "Since I was a teenager, I have a great interest in various fields in computer science . Alhough my major in college is English Education, my passion for it has been evident after I attened a coding bootcamp in 2017.",
    "The things I most like about coding is that I can really create something out of thin air, not from physical objects but from my mind! It's really nice when things come together to form a useful product or tool. It provides a great sense of accomplishment and personal pride. Beside that, I also like the debugging fixing part, I feel the satisfaction upon solving a bug or coding problem.",
    "Looking back, I'm really glad that I had stayed consistent with my dream and pursue what I'm passion about. Now I am a frontend developer with 2-year experience."
